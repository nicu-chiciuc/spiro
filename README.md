The project is a spirograph that can have multiple rotating arms.
This allows the creation of different interesting pictures.

The algorithm itself isn't very hard.
The biggest problem was creating a easy-to-use interface and also smoothing the curve by adding multiple points if the rotation is too fast.

The application doesn't use any build system.
